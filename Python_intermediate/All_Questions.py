# 1. Find the common elements between two lists.
# Given two lists, write a function to find the common elements between them.

# 2. Sort a list of tuples based on the second element in each tuple.
# Given a list of tuples, sort the list based on the second element of each tuple.

# 3. Count the frequency of each element in a list and return a dictionary.
# Write a function that takes a list of elements and returns a dictionary
# where the keys are the elements and the values are their respective counts in the list.

# 4. Remove a key from a dictionary if it exists, and return the updated dictionary.
# Given a dictionary and a key, remove the key if it exists in the dictionary
# and return the updated dictionary.

# 5. Merge two dictionaries by adding values for common keys.
# Given two dictionaries, merge them by adding the values for the common keys
# and keeping the values from both dictionaries for unique keys.

# 6. Find the longest word in a list of strings and return its length.
# Write a function to find the longest word in a list of strings and return its length.

# 7. Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains a key and its corresponding value from a dictionary.
# Given a dictionary, create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the key and its corresponding value.

# 8. Check if a tuple contains any duplicate elements.
# Write a function to check whether a tuple contains any duplicate elements and return `True` or `False`.

# 9. Flatten a list of tuples into a single list of elements.
# Given a list of tuples, flatten it into a single list by extracting all the elements from the tuples.

# 10. Write a function to find the intersection of two dictionaries.
# Given two dictionaries, write a function to find the common keys and their corresponding values in both dictionaries.
